# Why?

We found ourselves repating **`statuses`**
in various projects.
e.g:
[auth/init/**statuses.ex**](https://github.com/dwyl/auth/blob/568d0fd7a4a4f7ec53514c76e0e263c3f82e61ca/lib/auth/init/statuses.ex#L3-L106) <br />
So we decided to 
[**`"DRY"`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) 
it
and make this single-feature micro-package
we can reuse.

# What?

[`statuses.json`](https://github.com/dwyl/statuses/blob/main/lib/statuses.ex)
is a maintainable list of status structs
that anyone can read 
to be informed of **`statuses`**
used in our App(s).
It makes it easier for us to keep **`statuses`**
in one place 
and means 
anyone can contribute.

# Who?

This package is for us by us.
We don't expect anyone else to use it.
It's 
[Open Source](https://github.com/dwyl/intellectual-property)
so that
anyone using our Apps can view 
and contribute to the list.

# How?
## Installation

Add `statuses` 
to your dependencies 
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:statuses, "~> 1.1.1"},
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
statuses = Statuses.get_statuses()
# use them how you see fit
```

## Todo

Add link to where this is used in MVP.
